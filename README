Alias Refinement Types:
A syntax directed separation logic
==================================

This project contains the formalization of Alias Refinement Types (ART),
a refinement type system for an imperative programming language. This
comprises:

1. A Programming Language (Language.v)
2. A Program Logic (ProgramLogic.v)
3. A Type Language and Derivation Rules (Types.v and Judge.v).

As a proof of soundness, type derivations are translated
into proofs in the program logic (Translation.v).

Dependencies
============
This project depends on the verified software toolchain, which
should be installed in the same directory as the "*.v" files
($PROJECT_DIR), under $PROJECT_DIR/vst.
